# TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe was my first project in university. The project was made in source C code. The game mode is human vs human. I decided that the program needed some upgrades :D

How to test it:
  After the download, open the folder by the cmd (cd TicTacToe) and after that just write and execute "make" in the cmd.
